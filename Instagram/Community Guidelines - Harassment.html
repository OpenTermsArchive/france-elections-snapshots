politique</h4><div><p>Le harcèlement et l’intimidation se produisent en divers lieux et sous différentes formes, qu’il s’agisse de la diffusion d’informations personnelles identifiables, de l’envoi de messages de menace ou de contacts malveillants indésirés. Nous ne tolérons pas ce type de comportement, car il empêche les gens de se sentir respectés et en sécurité sur Facebook. </p><p>Nous distinguons les personnalités publiques des personnes privées, car notre plate-forme prône l’échange, ce qui implique souvent des commentaires critiques concernant des individus qui attirent l’attention des médias ou du grand public. En ce qui concerne les personnalités publiques, nous supprimons les attaques graves et certaines attaques qui identifient directement la personnalité publique dans une publication ou un commentaire. </p><p> Pour les personnes privées, notre protection va encore plus loin : nous supprimons le contenu visant à rabaisser une personne ou à la couvrir de honte et, notamment, les déclarations relatives aux activités sexuelles de quelqu’un. Nous reconnaissons que l’intimidation et le harcèlement peuvent avoir des répercussions émotionnelles plus graves sur les mineurs. C’est pourquoi nos politiques offrent une protection plus élevée pour les utilisateurs âgés de 13 à 18 ans.</p><p>Le contexte et l’intention importent ; nous autorisons les personnes à publier et partager des publications si le contenu vise clairement à condamner l’intimidation et le harcèlement ou à attirer l’attention sur ces comportements. Dans certains cas, nous demandons que la personne ciblée fasse elle-même le signalement, car cela nous permet de savoir qu’elle se sent intimidée et harcelée. En plus de signaler de tels comportements et contenus, nous encourageons les gens à utiliser <a href="https://www.facebook.com/safety/tools" target="_blank">les outils disponibles sur Facebook</a> pour se protéger contre ceux-ci.</p><p>Nous avons également une <a href="https://www.facebook.com/safety/bullying" target="_blank">plate-forme de prévention contre l’intimidation</a>, qui est une ressource destinée aux adolescents, aux parents et aux éducateurs cherchant un soutien pour les questions liées à l’intimidation et à d’autres conflits. Elle offre des conseils détaillés, y compris des informations sur la manière d’ouvrir des discussions importantes concernant l’intimidation. Apprenez-en davantage sur les mesures que nous prenons pour protéger les gens contre le harcèlement et l’intimidation <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/protecting-people-from-bullying/"
