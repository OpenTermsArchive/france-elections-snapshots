sexuelles, car certaines personnes au sein de notre communauté peuvent être sensibles à ce type de contenu. En outre, nous supprimons par défaut les images de nature sexuelle pour empêcher le partage de contenus montrant des actes non consentis ou des mineurs. Les restrictions sur l’affichage d’activité sexuelle s’appliquent également au contenu créé numériquement, sauf si le contenu est publié à des fins pédagogiques, humoristiques ou satiriques. <p>Avec le temps, nous avons adapté nos règlements relatifs à la nudité. Nous comprenons que les contenus montrant des scènes de nudité peuvent être partagés pour diverses raisons, notamment dans le cadre d’une protestation, pour sensibiliser à une cause, ou à des fins pédagogiques ou sanitaires. Par conséquent, nous acceptons les contenus respectant de tels motifs. Par exemple, alors que nous limitons certaines images de la poitrine féminine qui montrent le mamelon, nous autorisons d’autres types d’images, notamment celles illustrant des actes de protestation, des femmes défendant activement l’allaitement ou des cicatrices de mastectomie. Les images montrant ostensiblement des organes génitaux ou l’anus dans le contexte d’un accouchement, d’événements post-partum ou de situations relatives à la santé sont accompagnées d’un message d’avertissement afin d’informer qu’il s’agit d’un contenu potentiellement sensible. Nous autorisons également les photos de peintures, sculptures et autres œuvres d’art illustrant des personnages nus.</p></div><div class="_9nnu _9nnv _9r-u"></div><div><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M17.5 14H6.5C5.675 14 5 13.325 5 12.5C5 11.675 5.675 11 6.5 11H17.5C18.325 11 19 11.675 19 12.5C19 13.325 18.325 14 17.5 14ZM23.634 6.664L17.337 0.366C17.101 0.13 16.787 0 16.453 0H7.547C7.213 0 6.899 0.13 6.663 0.366L0.366 6.664C0.13 6.899 0 7.213 0 7.547V16.453C0 16.787 0.13 17.101 0.366 17.336L6.663 23.634C6.899 23.87 7.213 24 7.547 24H16.453C16.787 24 17.101 23.87 17.337 23.634L23.634 17.336C23.87 17.101 24 16.787 24 16.453V7.547C24 7.213 23.87 6.899 23.634 6.664Z" fill="#B92328"></path></svg><h4 class="_9nmv _9nsb _9nmz _9r-t _9qfm _9qfh _9nos">Ne publiez pas :</h4><div><p><ul class="_a6v9 _a6va _a6-3"><li>Images de corps d’adultes réels nus, si elles représentent : <ul class="_a6v9 _a6va _1265"><li>Des parties génitales visibles, hors contexte d’accouchement ou de moments post-accouchement, ou de situations liées à la santé (par exemple, opération de réassignation sexuelle, examen à des fins de dépistage du cancer ou prévention/diagnostic de maladie). </li><li>Un anus visible et/ou un gros plan sur des fesses entièrement exposées, sauf s’il s’agit d’un montage sur une personnalité publique.</li><li>Des mamelons de femme découverts, sauf lorsqu’il s’agit d’images illustrant l’allaitement, les moments pendant et après l’accouchement, des interventions dans le domaine médical (par exemple, mastectomie, sensibilisation au cancer du sein ou chirurgie de réattribution sexuelle) ou un acte de protestation.</li></ul></li><li>Des images d’activités sexuelles, notamment : <ul class="_a6v9 _a6va _1265"><li>Stimulation et activité sexuelle explicite <ul class="_a6v9 _a6va _1266"><li>Des rapports sexuels ou oraux explicites montrant une bouche ou des parties génitales entrant en contact avec les parties génitales ou l’anus d’une autre personne où au moins les parties génitales de l’une des personnes sont exposées.</li><li>Stimulation explicite de parties génitales ou de l’anus montrant la stimulation des parties génitales ou de l’anus ou l’insertion d’objets, y compris des sex toys dans les parties génitales ou l’anus, où les parties génitales et le contact avec ces parties du corps sont directement visibles.</li></ul></li><li>Stimulation et activité sexuelle implicite <ul class="_a6v9 _a6va _1266"><li>Des rapports sexuels implicites ou des rapports sexuels oraux montrant une bouche ou des parties génitales entrant en contact avec les parties génitales ou l’anus d’une autre personne, lorsque le contact n’est pas directement visible, sauf lorsqu’il s’agit de contenus entrant dans le cadre de la santé sexuelle, de publicités, ou d’images fictives reconnues ou des images montrant des signes de fiction.</li><li>La stimulation implicite des parties génitales ou de l’anus, ou l’insertion d’objets dans ou sur les parties génitales ou l’anus, y compris des sex toys, lorsque l’activité ou le contact n’est pas directement visible, sauf lorsqu’il s’agit de contenus entrant dans le cadre de la santé sexuelle, de publicités, ou d’images fictives reconnues ou des images montrant des signes de fiction.</li></ul></li><li>D’autres activités qui incluent, sans s’y limiter : <ul class="_a6v9 _a6va _1266"><li>Une érection</li><li>La présence de substances découlant d’une activité sexuelle.</li><li>Des sex toys placés sur ou insérés dans la bouche.</li><li>La stimulation de mamelons humains découverts.</li><li>Le palpage d’une poitrine féminine, défini comme un mouvement de prise où les doigts sont pliés et montrant à la fois des traces sur la poitrine ainsi qu’un changement de forme clair de celle-ci.
