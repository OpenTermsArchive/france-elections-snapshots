ou individus qui revendiquent des objectifs violents ou qui sont impliqués dans des activités violentes ne sont pas les bienvenus sur Facebook. Nous évaluons ces entités selon leur comportement en ligne et hors ligne, et plus particulièrement selon les liens qu’elles entretiennent avec la violence. Dans le cadre de cette politique, nous désignons des individus, des organisations et des réseaux de personnes. Ces désignations sont divisées en trois niveaux qui indiquent le niveau de mise en application du contenu, le niveau 1 entraînant la mise en application la plus étendue, car nous estimons que ces entités possèdent les liens les plus directs avec la violence hors ligne.</p><p>Le <b>niveau 1</b> se concentre sur les entités engagées dans des actes de violence hors ligne graves, notamment en organisant ou en prônant des actes de violence envers des civils, en déshumanisant ou en prônant à maintes reprises des actes de violence envers des personnes sur la base de caractéristiques protégées, ou en se livrant à des actes criminels systématiques. Les entités de niveau 1 comprennent les organisations terroristes, criminelles et incitant à la haine. Nous supprimons les éloges, les soutiens techniques et les représentations des entités de niveau 1 ainsi que de leurs dirigeants, fondateurs ou membres éminents. Le niveau 1 comprend les organisations incitant à la haine ; les organisations criminelles, notamment celles que les États-Unis nomment Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (c’est-à-dire les plaques tournantes du trafic de drogues) ; ainsi que les organisations terroristes, notamment les personnes et les entités que les États-Unis qualifient de Foreign Terrorist Organizations ou de Specially Designated Global Terrorists (organisations étrangères considérées comme terroristes). Nous supprimons les éloges, les soutiens techniques et les représentations des entités de niveau 1 ainsi que de leurs dirigeants, fondateurs ou membres éminents. </p><p>En outre, nous n’autorisons pas les contenus qui glorifient, soutiennent techniquement ou représentent des évènements que Facebook désigne comme des évènements violents en infraction, en ce compris des attaques terroristes, des évènements incitant à la haine, des (tentatives de) tueries, des meurtres en série ou des crimes de haine. Nous n’autorisons pas non plus les éloges, les soutiens techniques et les représentations des auteurs de ces attaques. Par ailleurs, nous supprimons les contenus qui glorifient, soutiennent techniquement ou représentent des idéologies qui incitent à la haine, telles que le nazisme et la suprématie blanche.</p><p>Le <b>niveau 2</b> porte sur les entités qui se livrent à des actes de violence envers des acteurs étatiques ou militaires, mais qui ne ciblent généralement pas des civils, ce que nous appelons des « acteurs violents non étatiques ». Nous supprimons tous les soutiens techniques et les représentations de ces entités ainsi que de leurs dirigeants et membres éminents. Nous supprimons tout éloge des actes de violence de ces groupes.</p><p>Le <b>niveau 3</b> concerne les entités susceptibles d’enfreindre à maintes reprises nos politiques en matière de discours incitant à la haine ou d’organismes dangereux sur la plateforme ou en dehors, ou de démontrer une forte intention de se livrer à des actes de violence hors ligne dans un avenir proche, mais qui ne sont pas nécessairement engagées dans des actes de violence à ce jour ou qui n’ont pas prôné la violence envers d’autres personnes sur la base de leurs caractéristiques protégées. Il s’agit notamment des mouvements sociaux militarisés, des réseaux de conspiration incitant à la violence ainsi que des individus ou groupes bannis pour avoir incité à la haine. Les entités de niveau 3 peuvent ne pas être présentes ni se coordonner sur nos plateformes. </p><p>Nous reconnaissons que les utilisateurs peuvent partager des contenus incluant des références à des organismes et des individus dangereux pour les signaler, les condamner ou engager une discussion neutre sur leurs activités. Nos politiques sont conçues pour permettre ce type de discussions, mais nous demandons aux utilisateurs d’indiquer clairement leur intention. Nous nous réservons le droit de supprimer le contenu concerné lorsque l’intention n’est pas claire.</p></div><div class="_9nnu _9nnv _9r-u"></div><div><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M17.5 14H6.5C5.675 14 5 13.325 5 12.5C5 11.675 5.675 11 6.5 11H17.5C18.325 11 19 11.675 19 12.5C19 13.325 18.325 14 17.5 14ZM23.634 6.664L17.337 0.366C17.101 0.13 16.787 0 16.453 0H7.547C7.213 0 6.899 0.13 6.663 0.366L0.366 6.664C0.13 6.899 0 7.213 0 7.547V16.453C0 16.787 0.13 17.101 0.366 17.336L6.663 23.634C6.899 23.87 7.213 24 7.547 24H16.453C16.787 24 17.101 23.87 17.337 23.634L23.634 17.336C23.87 17.101 24 16.787 24 16.453V7.547C24 7.213 23.87 6.899 23.634 6.664Z" fill="#B92328"></path></svg><h4 class="_9nmv _9nsb _9nmz _9r-t _9qfm _9qfh _9nos">Nous supprimons :</h4><div><p>Nous supprimons les éloges, les soutiens techniques et les représentations de divers organismes dangereux.
