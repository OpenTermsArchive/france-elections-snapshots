utilisent nos apps. Nous consultons régulièrement des experts en suicide et automutilation pour soutenir nos politiques et leur mise en application et collaborer avec des organisations du monde entier pour assister les personnes en détresse. </p><p> Bien qu’il ne soit pas permis de glorifier ou de promouvoir volontairement ou non l’automutilation ou le suicide, nous autorisons les discussions sur ce sujet, parce que nous souhaitons faire de Facebook un espace où chacun peut partager ses expériences, sensibiliser à ces fléaux et rechercher un soutien mutuel. </p><p> Nous définissons l’automutilation comme le fait de se blesser le corps de manière directe et volontaire, ce qui peut notamment s’exprimer sous forme de blessures superficielles ou de troubles de l’alimentation. Nous supprimons tout contenu qui encourage le suicide ou l’automutilation, y compris le contenu fictif comme les mèmes ou illustrations et tout contenu explicite d’automutilation, peu importe le contexte. Nous supprimons aussi le contenu qui identifie et cible négativement des victimes ou survivants d’une tentative de suicide ou d’une automutilation, que ce soit sérieusement ou de manière humoristique ou rhétorique, ainsi que les images en temps réel de suicide ou d’automutilation. Le contenu sur le rétablissement après une tentative de suicide ou une automutilation qui est autorisé, mais peut contenir des images potentiellement dérangeantes, est placé derrière un écran de sensibilité. </p><p> Lorsque des personnes publient ou recherchent du contenu lié au suicide ou à l’automutilation, nous les redirigerons vers les organisations locales qui peuvent apporter un soutien à une personne qui présente un risque imminent d’automutilation, nous contacterons les services d’urgence locaux pour leur venir en aide. </p><p> Concernant le contenu en direct, les experts nous ont indiqué que si une personne déclarait qu’elle avait l’intention de faire une tentative de suicide sur un streaming en direct, nous devrions conserver le contenu aussi longtemps que possible, car plus une personne parle devant une caméra, plus il y a de chances qu’un ami ou un membre de sa famille appelle les services d’urgence. </p><p> Cependant, pour minimiser le risque d’un impact négatif sur des tiers à la suite du visionnage de ce contenu, nous stopperons le streaming en direct au moment où la menace devient une tentative. Comme indiqué ci-dessus, nous contacterons dans tous les cas les services d’urgence si nous identifions qu’une personne présente un risque imminent de se faire du mal. </p></div><div class="_9nnu
