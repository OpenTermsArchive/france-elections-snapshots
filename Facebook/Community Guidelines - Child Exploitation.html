Lorsque nous prenons connaissance d&#039;un cas apparent d&#039;exploitation infantile, nous le signalons au National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), conformément à la loi en vigueur. Nous savons que des personnes partagent parfois des images nues de leurs propres enfants avec de bonnes intentions. Cependant, nous supprimons généralement ces images en raison du risque d’abus par d’autres personnes, mais aussi pour éviter que ces images puissent être réutilisées ou détournées. <p>Nous travaillons également avec des experts externes, notamment le <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/222332597793306?ref=ccs" target="_blank">Conseil de sécurité de Facebook</a>, pour discuter et améliorer nos politiques et leur application autour des problèmes de sécurité en ligne, en particulier en ce qui concerne les enfants. Apprenez-en davantage sur la <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/fighting-child-exploitation/" data-lnfb-mode="ie">technologie que nous utilisons pour lutter contre l’exploitation
