politique</h4><div><p>Nous pensons que les personnes s’expriment et interagissent plus librement lorsqu’elles ne se sentent pas attaquées sur la base de ce qu’elles sont. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous interdisons tout type de discours haineux sur Facebook. Ces derniers créent un environnement intimidant et excluant et peuvent, dans certains cas, faire l’apologie de la violence hors ligne.</p><p>Nous définissons les discours haineux comme une attaque directe contre des personnes, plutôt que contre des concepts ou des institutions, fondée sur ce que nous appelons des caractéristiques protégées : l’origine ethnique, l’origine nationale, le handicap, la religion, la caste, l’orientation sexuelle, le genre, l’identité de genre, et les maladies graves. Nous définissons une attaque comme un discours violent ou déshumanisant, des stéréotypes offensants, une affirmation d’infériorité, une expression de mépris, de dégoût ou de renvoi, une insulte ou un appel à l’exclusion ou à la ségrégation. Nous interdisons également l’utilisation de stéréotypes préjudiciables, que nous définissons comme des comparaisons déshumanisantes historiquement utilisées pour attaquer, intimider ou exclure des groupes spécifiques et souvent liées à la violence hors ligne. Nous considérons l’âge comme une caractéristique protégée lorsqu’il est mentionné parallèlement à une autre caractéristique protégée. Nous protégeons également les réfugiés, les migrants, les immigrants et les demandeurs d&#039;asile contre les attaques les plus graves, bien que nous autorisions les commentaires et les critiques sur les politiques d’immigration. Dans le même ordre d’idées, nous protégeons certaines caractéristiques, comme la profession, lorsqu’elles sont mentionnées parallèlement à une caractéristique protégée. En fonction des nuances locales, nous considérons parfois certains mots ou certaines phrases comme des mots de code pour les groupes de CP. </p><p>Nous reconnaissons que les utilisateurs partagent parfois des contenus incluant un discours haineux de quelqu&#039;un d&#039;autre pour le condamner ou sensibiliser les autres à son égard. Dans d’autre cas, des discours qui pourraient enfreindre nos standards peuvent être utilisés de manière autoréférentielle ou de manière valorisante. Nos politiques sont conçues pour permettre ce type de discours, mais nous demandons aux utilisateurs d’indiquer clairement leur intention. Nous nous réservons le droit de supprimer le contenu concerné lorsque l’intention n’est pas claire.</p><p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/"
